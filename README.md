# Kickstarter Analysis for Louise

## Overview of Project
This project was created to determine the outcomes of different kickstarter campaigns in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Purpose
To better inform Louise when she should launch her campaign and what her funding goal should be.
## Analysis and Challenges
Using the dataset I analyzed what campaign outcomes for plays were successful, which failed, and which were canceled based on the month they launched and the funding goal amount.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The data was sorted to create a pivot table showing the outcomes for theater projects for each month.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The data was analyzed to chart the relationship betweenthe goal-amount ranges and the project outcomes.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I had problems writing the formulas correctly so that it would pull the right data.
## Results
I would recommend to Louise that if she were to launch a kickstarter campaign for her play she should start it in May with a goal of less than $1000. Historically that has been when plays have been most successful.
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Based on the data, the best time to launch would be in May or June. May had a 67% success rate while June had a 65% success rate.
The highest failure rate was in December with 47% of projects failing.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Based on the data, the funding goal with the highest success rate was less than $1000
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The success of a play isn't solely based on the month and how much money was raised. Where the campaign is launched could also determine the outcome.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We can look at which countries had the most failed plays in the year 2014.
We could create a graph showing the correlation between staff picks and successful tabletop games.
